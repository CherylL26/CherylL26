### Welcome!

I'm Chu Yin (or Cheryl), an 11th grader from Texas. I'm 16.

I want to learn more about open source software, machine learning and back end development. I can do some programming in Python, C++ and Java, and I have some web development experience with React and Flask.

I also like math and creative writing!
